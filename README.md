Farsi/Arabic Language Application Development


When Windows did not natively support Farsi or Arabic, or even right-to-left, we at Behin System (a small software company that I used to work for in late 90s and early 2000s) developed a set of components for Delphi (startig at Delphi 4.0)

Later, the persian date/time component was ported to Java and .NET
